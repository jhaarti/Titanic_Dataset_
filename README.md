# Titanic_Dataset_
LOGISTIC REGRESSION.
The famous Titanic Dataset from Kaggle is used here to show various preprocessing techniques, involving data analysis, imputation, model learning.
Only the train.csv file is used here that's why I have uploaded only the train.csv dataset. If you want to explore, you may go to Kaggle and you will find the test.csv to do further practice on.
